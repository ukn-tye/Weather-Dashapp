# WeatherApp
This is my Module 6 assignment. This was a challenging assignment for me at the beginning of this course but I came back to this assignment after laerning all lot of new material and altered the one I had before so that now I can turn in a working and better looking repository. In this challenge I was expected to create a working weather app that useed a fetch call to a weather ``API`` and use it to put the missing information into my app. I had to recreate my whole entire assigment due to plagarism but since then I have fixwed everything and completley changed it again but used the same vision and look.
